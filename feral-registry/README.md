# feral-registry

The **community marketplace** behind [`registry.feral.sh`](https://registry.feral.sh).
A small FastAPI service that lets anyone publish, browse, download, and flag Feral
artifacts — *skills*, *daemons*, and *MCP servers* — with cryptographic provenance.

---

## Trust model

feral-registry is intentionally minimal. It does **not** try to sandbox code. It
only guarantees **who** signed a given bundle and **what bytes** were uploaded.

- Every publisher authenticates with **GitHub OAuth** and is identified by their
  GitHub handle (`github_login`, globally unique).
- On first publish, a publisher registers an **Ed25519 public key** via
  `POST /api/v1/auth/github/register_pubkey`. The private key lives on the
  publisher's machine; the registry never sees it.
- `POST /api/v1/publish` requires a **detached Ed25519 signature** over the
  hex-encoded `sha256` of the bundle. If the signature does not verify against
  the publisher's registered pubkey, the upload is rejected.
- The signature is stored alongside the item so clients can **re-verify on
  download**. The pubkey is returned from `GET /api/v1/item/{id}`.
- A small allow-list of GitHub handles (`FEATURED_PUBLISHERS` env var) is marked
  `verified: true` in the catalog. Everyone else starts unverified. "Verified"
  is **not** a security claim — it is an editorial "we recognize this
  publisher" badge. Signature verification is the real trust boundary.
- Anyone can `POST /api/v1/flag/{id}` with a reason; flags are stored for human
  moderation.

### Bundle format

A bundle is a single tarball (`.tar.gz`) that contains:

- the manifest JSON for a skill/daemon/MCP (as documented in `feral-core`),
- the implementation files referenced by the manifest.

The `manifest_json` form field submitted at publish time MUST match the manifest
embedded in the tarball. The registry verifies only the top-level shape (`kind`,
`name`, `version`); deeper validation is the client's responsibility.

## Routes

All endpoints live under `/api/v1`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| GET    | `/healthz` | liveness probe |
| GET    | `/auth/github/login` | redirect to GitHub OAuth consent |
| GET    | `/auth/github/callback?code=...` | exchange code, issue `publisher_token` (HS256 JWT, 30-day TTL) |
| POST   | `/auth/github/register_pubkey` | register Ed25519 pubkey (hex) for the authenticated publisher |
| POST   | `/publish` | multipart upload: `bundle`, `signature`, `manifest_json`. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <publisher_token>`. |
| GET    | `/catalog?kind=&q=&sort=newest\|popular` | list items |
| GET    | `/item/{id}` | item detail including download URL, pubkey, and signature |
| POST   | `/flag/{id}` | community moderation flag |
| GET    | `/blobs/{sha256}` | serve a bundle blob; increments `downloads` |

Every route returns typed Pydantic models.

If `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` is unset, the `/auth/github/*` endpoints return
**501 Not Implemented** with `{"detail": "not configured"}` — the rest of the
service still works for local dev.

## Local dev

```bash
cd ASOS/feral-registry

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

cp .env.example .env          # then edit as needed

alembic upgrade head          # creates tables (SQLite by default)

uvicorn feral_registry.main:app --reload
```

Open <http://localhost:8080/docs> for the OpenAPI UI.

### Running the test suite

```bash
pytest
```

The included end-to-end test (`tests/test_publish_flow.py`) generates an
Ed25519 keypair in-memory, registers a fake publisher, publishes a tiny signed
tarball, and asserts that the catalog surfaces it.

---

## Environment variables

| Var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| `FERAL_REGISTRY_DB_URL` | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./registry.db` | SQLAlchemy async URL. Use `postgresql+asyncpg://...` in prod. |
| `FERAL_REGISTRY_BLOB_DIR` | `./_blobs` | Directory where `.tar.gz` bundles are written. |
| `FERAL_REGISTRY_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Base URL used to build `download_url`s. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | *(unset)* | OAuth app client ID. When unset, auth routes return 501. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(unset)* | OAuth app client secret. |
| `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI` | `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/github/callback` | Must match the OAuth app config. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `dev-insecure-change-me` | HS256 signing secret for publisher tokens. **Set a real one in prod.** |
| `FEATURED_PUBLISHERS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated GitHub handles whose items get `verified: true`. |

### Creating a GitHub OAuth app

1. <https://github.com/settings/developers> → **New OAuth App**.
2. Homepage URL: `https://registry.feral.sh` (or your dev URL).
3. Authorization callback URL: must match `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI`.
4. Generate a client secret and set both values via `fly secrets set ...` (see
   below) or in your local `.env`.

## Deploying to Fly.io

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy            # accept the generated app name "feral-registry"
fly volumes create feral_registry_data --region iad --size 1

fly secrets set \
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=xxx \
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx \
  GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=https://registry.feral.sh/api/v1/auth/github/callback \
  JWT_SECRET="$(python -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))')" \
  FEATURED_PUBLISHERS=feral,theora

fly deploy

fly ssh console -C "alembic upgrade head"
fly ssh console -C "python -m scripts.seed_first_party"   # optional; see below
```

`fly.toml` mounts a 1 GB volume at `/data` for the SQLite database and the
blob directory. To move to Postgres, set `FERAL_REGISTRY_DB_URL` to an
`asyncpg` URL and rerun `alembic upgrade head`.

The `Procfile` is provided for platforms that prefer buildpacks (Render,
Railway, Heroku-style).

---

## Publishing a bundle (client side)

Use the `feral` CLI from `ASOS/feral-client`:

```bash
feral login                     # opens GitHub OAuth, stores publisher_token locally
feral keygen                    # generates Ed25519 keypair, uploads pubkey
feral publish --skill ./my_skill/
```

Under the hood the client:

1. Builds `my_skill.tar.gz` from the skill directory.
2. Computes `sha256(bundle)` and signs the hex digest with the local Ed25519
   private key.
3. `POST`s `bundle`, `signature`, and `manifest_json` to
   `POST /api/v1/publish` with the stored `publisher_token`.

Daemons (`feral publish --daemon ./my_daemon/`) and MCP servers
(`feral publish --mcp ./my_mcp/`) use the exact same endpoint.

---

## Seeding first-party items

After the first deploy you will want the official Feral skills and daemons to
show up as `verified` items in the catalog. Run:

```bash
fly ssh console -C "python -m scripts.seed_first_party"
```

The script reads `ASOS/feral-core/skills/manifests/*.json`, builds matching
tarballs from the referenced implementations, signs them with a `first_party`
seed key, and inserts them as verified items under the `feral` publisher. It
also seeds the `w300_daemon` and `wristband_daemon` entries from
`ASOS/feral-nodes/`.

The seed script is **idempotent** — running it twice skips already-present
`(kind, name, version)` tuples.
