"""Runtime smoke test for an installed ``feral-ai`` wheel.

Shared by two stages of the release pipeline:

1. ``publish.yml`` pre-publish gate: runs against the freshly built wheel
   inside an ephemeral virtualenv before anything leaves the build job.
2. ``publish.yml`` canary stage: runs after ``pip install`` from the
   staging index (e.g. TestPyPI) so we prove the *uploaded* artifact
   installs cleanly and answers HTTP the same way it did at build time.

Contract (fail loudly on any of these):

* ``feral-ai`` is importable and advertises a version via
  ``importlib.metadata``.
* The bundled ``webui_v2`` directory is present as a site-packages
  sibling of ``api/`` (this is the regression that shipped 2026.4.17
  when a hyphenated dir got silently dropped from the wheel).
* ``webui_v2/index.html`` and at least one ``assets/*.js`` +
  ``assets/*.css`` are present.
* The FastAPI app boots under ``TestClient`` and:
  * ``/health`` returns 200,
  * ``/`` with the API key returns 200 and contains the v2 bundle
    markers (``FERAL`` + ``v2``) and does *not* contain the v1
    fallback marker.

This script is intentionally dependency-light: it relies only on what
the installed wheel already brings in (``fastapi``'s ``TestClient``
ships via ``httpx`` in the wheel's runtime deps).

Usage::

    python scripts/release_wheel_smoke.py [--expected-version X.Y.Z]

Exit code is 0 on success, 1 on any contract violation.
