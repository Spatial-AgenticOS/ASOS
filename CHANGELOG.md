# Changelog

All notable changes to FERAL are documented here.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-09

### Security
- Path traversal guard on catch-all WebUI route (`resolve()` + `is_relative_to()`)
- SQL injection whitelist on P2P sync table names (only `notes`, `episodes`, `conversations`, `knowledge`, `wiki_pages`)
- CORS restricted from wildcard `*` to `localhost:5173,localhost:9090`
- XSS prevention via DOMPurify sanitization on server-driven UI renderer
- Docker sandbox refuses host execution when Docker is unavailable
- Direct shell command injection disabled in daemon direct execution
- Default bind address hardened from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1`
- `NODE_API_KEY` no longer ships with a default value
- Gemini API key moved from URL query strings to request headers
- Shell command safety filter blocks dangerous patterns in skill executor
- Tool safety classification reordered: CONFIRM checked before AUTO

### Fixed
- Digital twin LLM response parsing (uses `extract_response()`)
- `register_instance` import order in `api/state.py`
- Handoff router mounted in `api/server.py`
- Proactive automation executor uses `get_implementation()` directly
- Sensor value chain: `is not None` checks replace falsy-zero `or` chains
- Knowledge triple overwrite: unique `note_{id}` subjects per note
- WebSocket node auth: accepts connection before closing with code 4003
- SQLite connection leaks: `try/finally` across 32 methods in 3 files
- FTS UPDATE triggers added for `notes`, `knowledge`, `entities` tables
- HLC string comparison replaced with parsed `(wall_ms, counter, node_id)` tuples
- DevicePairingStore consolidated to single instance in BrainState
- WebSocket reconnect leak: `unmountedRef` guard prevents post-unmount reconnection
- CommandPalette empty-state crash: guard against empty results
- Dashboard: `fetch()` replaces per-click WebSocket creation
- Ambient page keyboard hijack: skips input/textarea/contenteditable elements
- Settings Export/Clear Memory buttons wired with handlers
- WebSocket message format normalized to `{ hop, type, payload }`

### Added
- React Error Boundary wrapping the app root
- ESLint with `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule for frontend
- 85 ToolRunner tests covering safety classification, enforcement, anti-loop, approval lifecycle
- `test_safety.py` rewritten to test production code instead of duplicated logic

- Frontend coverage thresholds: 20% statements, 15% branches/functions
