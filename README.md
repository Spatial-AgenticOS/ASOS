## What FERAL Is

FERAL is a local-first brain that sits in the middle of your software and physical devices. You run it on your own machine and connect apps, channels, and hardware through one runtime.

Core model:

- 4-layer memory: working context, episodic events, semantic/graph retrieval, and execution history.
- Baseline learning: rolling metrics and anomaly/trend detection for what "normal" looks like for you.
- Digital twin actions: policy-gated autonomy with approval, time-window, and daily-cap controls.
- Publisher model: developers ship headless API/CLI contracts and app manifests; FERAL renders structured Gen-UI surfaces locally.
- Registry review gate: submissions are not user-installable until approved by FERAL org reviewers.

Today this ships as `feral-core` (brain runtime), `feral-client-v2` (web control surface), and `feral-nodes` (device/node bridges).

## Status

- Package: [`feral-ai`](https://pypi.org/project/feral-ai/) on PyPI. Current CalVer is shown in the version badge above and tracks `feral-core/pyproject.toml`.
- Maturity: **Public beta**. Single-user local deployment is the primary target. Multi-user / HA scenarios are not in scope yet.
- Supported hosts: **macOS 13+** and **modern Linux** (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 40+, Arch). Windows is not supported yet — use WSL2.
- Default startup mode: "This Mac only" pairing until you opt into LAN or Anywhere.

## Quickstart (PyPI first)

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
pip install "feral-ai[all]"
feral setup
feral start
```

`feral setup` is an arrow-key driven wizard (space to mark, enter to confirm). It walks you through:

1. **LLM provider** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, LM Studio, Together, OpenRouter, Fireworks, Bedrock, …) with masked API key paste.
2. **Model** (type to filter through hundreds of model ids).
3. **Speech in / out** (cloud or fully local).
4. **Identity** (so the agent knows who it is talking to).
5. **Network access** — `localhost` (default), `LAN` (`0.0.0.0` so phones on the same Wi-Fi can pair), or `Tailscale Funnel` (free public DNS for cross-internet pairing).
6. **Optional**: Home Assistant, messaging channels.

Then open `http://localhost:9090`.

What this gives you:

- A local brain server on port `9090`.
- Bundled Web UI v2 served by the brain.
- Local config under `~/.feral/` (settings + encrypted vault for keys).

Useful commands:

```bash
feral serve            # headless brain only (no chat / no client)
feral status           # runtime status
feral doctor           # diagnostics — what's reachable, what needs setup
feral access status    # current pairing / network mode
feral key paste        # add or rotate a credential without re-running setup
```

If you prefer the installer script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FERAL-AI/FERAL-AI/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
source ~/.feral-env/bin/activate
feral start
```

## Pair Your Phone: LAN vs Anywhere

FERAL exposes three pairing modes:

| Mode | UI label | Best for | Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `local` | Same WiFi | Phone and brain on same network | Brain must be reachable on LAN |
| `remote` | Anywhere | Pair/use from outside your LAN | Tailscale installed and Funnel enabled |
| `localhost` | This Mac only | No phone pairing yet | No extra setup |

### LAN (Same WiFi)

1. In setup, choose **Same WiFi**.
2. Open `Devices` -> `Pair new device` -> `Web phone`.
3. Click **Generate one-time link** and scan the QR from your phone.
4. If PIN is enabled, enter the 4-digit PIN shown on the Mac.

If the generated LAN URL is unreachable from your phone, restart the brain on all interfaces:

```bash
FERAL_HOST=0.0.0.0 feral start
```

### Anywhere (Remote via Tailscale)

Setup now attempts this automatically when you choose **Anywhere**.
You can also manage it later in `Settings` -> `Access`.

1. In setup, choose **Anywhere**.
2. If setup reports a tunnel error, run:

```bash
feral access remote-up
```

3. Complete any Tailscale prompts (`tailscale up`, Funnel enable URL) if requested.
4. Generate a new pairing link from `Devices` and scan it from anywhere.

Check status any time:

```bash
feral access status
```

Disable remote mode:

```bash
feral access remote-down
```

### This Mac only

Use this if you want local dashboard/chat without phone pairing yet.

## What Gen-UI Actually Does

Gen-UI in FERAL is server-driven UI (SDUI), not freeform frontend generation.

- The brain emits structured UI payloads; the client renders known component types.
- Payload updates can be streamed as `sdui_patch` deltas.
- Third-party app surfaces run in a sandboxed model with explicit contracts.
- The `/canvas` view is a live inspector/debug surface for SDUI frames.

What it is not yet:

- Not a native iOS/Android SDUI renderer parity story.
- Not a fully signed marketplace trust model end-to-end.

## Stable Today

<!-- sync-versions:test-counts pytest=3581 vitest=299 -->
Current CI snapshot: **2842 backend + 259 frontend tests**.
<!-- /sync-versions:test-counts -->

| Area | Current state |
|---|---|
| Chat and LLM orchestration | Stable |
| Memory core (episodic/semantic/graph) | Stable |
| Setup + CLI runtime control | Stable |
| Web UI v2 core flows | Stable |
| Pairing lifecycle (token, claim, prune) | Stable |
| Voice, channels, and integrations | Stable with provider/runtime dependencies |
| Gen-UI advanced app-platform features | Mixed (stable core renderer, evolving platform contracts) |
| Long-tail ecosystem claims | Vary by integration; verify before production commitments |

## Recent Release Focus

For the full per-release breakdown see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Highlights from the last few releases:

- **`v2026.5.23`** — fixes a P0 in `feral setup` where the InquirerPy arrow-key picker silently fell back to a typed numeric prompt because the wizard ran inside `asyncio.run()`. Adds the raccoon ASCII logo banner, "── Step N of M ──" indicators, and the space-to-mark + enter-to-confirm picker pattern.
- **`v2026.5.22`** — first interactive CLI overhaul: arrow-key provider/model picker, masked API key paste, raccoon brand chrome across `feral setup` / `install` / `key` / `access`, and a new "Network access" wizard step (localhost / LAN / Tailscale Funnel). Bundles the audit-r10 brain overhaul (PRs #105–#119).
- **`v2026.5.20`** — agent runtime recovery: canonical execution + Desktop grants, Playwright/CDP browser runtime + tracing/HAR/downloads, provider-neutral ComputerUseDriver, CodingRun loop, sub-sessions REST + GoalChecker, MemoryRetriever + IntentGate, in-composer voice, uploads end-to-end, Google/Microsoft OAuth + manifests + MCP projection.
