"""PR 7: GoalChecker — deterministic done/blocked/continue verdict for
long-horizon work (W17 subsessions, TaskFlows, IntentCompiler plans).

Design
------
The goal checker is *not* an LLM. It's a small, auditable rules engine
that an autonomy loop calls between micro-steps to decide whether to:

* ``done``     — the user-visible objective is satisfied and the loop
                should stop.
* ``blocked``  — progress is stuck on something the runtime cannot
                resolve on its own (a permission grant, a missing
                credential, a captcha, a destructive confirmation),
                so the loop should surface a remediation card and
                yield control to the operator.
* ``continue`` — neither of the above; the loop may take another
                micro-step.

The decision is derived from a typed ``GoalContext`` so we can unit-test
the matrix exhaustively. Higher layers may *also* prompt an LLM for a
free-form verdict, but the LLM's answer is never trusted on its own:
the checker enforces the safety floor that "blocked" beats "continue"
whenever a permission/error signal is present, and "done" beats
"continue" only when the criteria explicitly evaluate True.

This module is intentionally framework-agnostic. It does not import
asyncio, FastAPI, or the orchestrator. The wiring layer (route /
runtime) builds the GoalContext from its own state and calls
``check_goal``.
