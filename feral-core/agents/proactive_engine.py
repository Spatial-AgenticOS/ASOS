"""
FERAL Proactive Intelligence Engine
======================================
The #1 differentiator: FERAL doesn't wait for commands — it observes
ambient context (screen, health, calendar, memory) and proactively
initiates when it has something valuable to say.

This is NOT a simple cron. It's a context-aware decision engine with:
  - Priority tiers (critical > important > suggestion > ambient)
  - Cooldown per trigger type (don't nag)
  - User preference learning (track dismiss rates)
  - Time-of-day awareness
  - LLM evaluation for complex triggers

Architecture:
  PerceptionFrame + MemoryStore + Clock
    → TriggerEvaluator (rules + LLM hybrid)
    → ProactiveMessage
    → Delivery (voice / toast / SDUI card)
