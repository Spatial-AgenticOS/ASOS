"""W3-A14: narrow sandbox facade.

This module defines a tiny port (protocol + default adapter) so code paths
that previously reached into the global ``BrainState`` to fetch
``docker_sandbox`` / ``wasm_sandbox`` can depend on a focused interface
instead.

Design goals:
- One responsibility: hand back the sandbox engines, nothing else.
- Production-safe: default adapter lazy-imports ``api.state.state`` so import
  order/tests that don't construct a BrainState still work.
- Replaceable in tests by injecting a custom adapter (no ``monkeypatch`` of
  ``api.state``).

Behavior is intentionally identical to the previous inline lookups in
``skills.executor`` and ``skills.impl.workspace_scripts``: returning ``None``
when the sandbox isn't wired yet.
