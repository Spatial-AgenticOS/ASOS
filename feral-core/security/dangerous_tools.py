"""
FERAL Dangerous Tool Registry
Centralized policy for which tools are restricted on which surfaces.

Pattern: central deny lists per execution surface.

Usage
-----
1. Gate execution: call ``is_tool_allowed(name, surface)`` before dispatch; if False, refuse.
2. UX / policy: ``get_danger_level`` and ``requires_approval`` drive prompts and exec-approval
   flows (see ``security.exec_approvals``).
3. Extend ``TOOL_DANGER_MAP`` when new tools ship; keep names aligned with MCP / internal registry
   strings so policy stays a single source of truth.

Surfaces
--------
- ``http_api``: remote, minimally trusted — block shell, Docker, and arbitrary JS in browser.
- ``websocket``: interactive channel — still block host-level Docker exec.
- ``local_cli``: operator-controlled — no static denies (policy can still require approval).

Naming compatibility
--------------------
Two naming conventions coexist in the codebase:

* Legacy / external (MCP, providers): dotted ``skill.endpoint`` (e.g. ``shell.exec``).
* Internal skills / LLM tool ids: double-underscore ``skill__endpoint``
  (e.g. ``desktop_control__shell_command``).

Deny-list matching normalises a tool name into multiple candidate forms so a
single policy entry catches both shapes — adding ``shell.exec`` denies
``shell__exec`` too, and vice versa. Bare endpoint names are NOT auto-matched
to keep the policy explicit; if you need that you must add the bare name.
