"""W13: enforce that the prometheus_client REGISTRY is in lockstep with
the default Grafana dashboard and Prometheus alert rules.

If a panel or alert references a metric we never registered, the
exposition will be empty and operators will silently miss signal.
If we register a metric no panel or alert ever consumes, it's dead
code and we burn cardinality budget for nothing. This test fails the
build on either drift.

Owned paths: feral-core/observability/metrics.py,
ops/grafana/feral-overview.json, ops/prometheus/alerts.yml.
