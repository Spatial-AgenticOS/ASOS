"""Phase 1 (audit-r10 overhaul) regression tests — `device_target` field
+ ExecutionSurfacePolicy resolver.

Operator report 2026-05-13 (audit-r10 #4 + #8):
> "the chat on the app when I ask for something to be add on my desktop
>  ... it says that it has no access and then asks for approval, but
>  then it comes back and it asks to enable something from the settings
>  on my mac but nothing there and never works"

Root cause: `security/dangerous_tools.py` mapped `phone_surface` →
`http_api` unconditionally, hard-denying every Mac-side actuation tool
(`computer_use__bash`, `desktop_control__shell_command`,
`agentic_computer_use__execute_task`). The LLM saw the deny and
hallucinated "go to Settings" prose.

Phase 1 fix: introduce `device_target` ∈ {"brain", "phone", "glasses",
"auto", None} on `ChatRequestPayload` + `HUPActionRequestPayload`. The
resolver consults `device_target` first; only falls back to source→
surface for `auto` / None. New surfaces:
  - `brain_host` — operator's Mac, full desktop control allowed
  - `phone_actuator` — phone runs `phone.*` skills only (Phase 4)

These tests pin the wire contract + the resolver behavior so a future
refactor cannot silently regress to the old hard-deny.
