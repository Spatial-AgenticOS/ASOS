"""W18: scope_cancel kills every matching child within 200ms.

Mirrors openclaw's ``cancelScope`` contract — composes with W17's
scope_key concept. Spec: spawn 5 children with scope_key="batch-A",
1 child with scope_key="batch-B"; call scope_cancel("batch-A");
assert all 5 dead within 200ms; assert the survivor still running.

Cites docs/OPENCLAW_LESSONS.md §2 + §10 W18.
