"""W21 — generic send/receive contract test.

Purpose: any in-tree adapter that ships a ``feral-channel.manifest.json``
must satisfy the **manifest-declared capability surface** end-to-end
(stubbed network). Today only Telegram is migrated, so the contract
runs against Telegram. As W21.2 lands additional manifests, each one
gets parametrised in here automatically — no per-channel test rewrites.

Key idea: the test does NOT import ``TelegramChannel`` by name. It
walks ``loader.discover_bundled()``, looks up the channel's
implementation through a small in-test bridge, and exercises the
abstract-base-class surface from ``channels/base.py``. That bridge is
the seam that W21.3's full SDK will formalise; here it's a 5-line
mapping so we can keep this PR scoped to Phase 1.
