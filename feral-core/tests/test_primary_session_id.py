"""Audit-r9 regression test: web + phone share `state.primary_session_id`.

Operator report 2026-05-10:
> "the chat and memory should be the same for my phone chat and the
>  webui for feral brain on the local brain right?"

Yes. Until this fix, web `/v1/session` minted `uuid4()` per WebSocket
(`api/server.py:835`) and phone `chat_request` used `phone-{node_id}`
(`api/server.py:1486`). Result: `Orchestrator.conversation_history[
session_id]` and the working-memory deque were partitioned per
surface AND per browser tab.

Now both default to `state.primary_session_id` — a stable per-install
id minted on first boot and persisted at
`<feral_data_home>/primary_session_id`. Explicit client-supplied
`session_id` still wins.

These tests pin:
1. Persistence — the id survives a `BrainState` rebuild.
2. Env override — `FERAL_PRIMARY_SESSION_ID` short-circuits the file.
3. Filesystem-failure fallback — never blocks boot.
4. The phone `chat_request` resolver picks primary over the legacy
   `phone-{node_id}` fallback.
