"""Pin the freshness gate on proactive HR / SpO2 alerts.

Operator report (2026-05-09): the FERAL web-UI showed
``Heart Rate Alert: 115 bpm`` while the W300 glasses were
disconnected. The number was NOT fake — it came from
``Apple HealthKit`` returning the most-recent recorded HR sample
(possibly hours old, e.g. from a workout that morning). The
proactive engine fired on the stale value as if it were a
real-time reading.

Fix: ``PerceptionFrame`` now tracks per-metric sample timestamps
(``heart_rate_sample_ts``, ``spo2_sample_ts``) and source labels
(``heart_rate_source``, ``spo2_source``). The proactive engine's
``_evaluate`` requires the sample to be within
``FRESH_WINDOW_S`` (120s) of "now" before firing. The notification
body surfaces the source + sample age so the user can audit.

This test pins the freshness gate end-to-end through ``_evaluate``.
