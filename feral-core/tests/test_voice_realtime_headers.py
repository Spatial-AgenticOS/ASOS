"""Regression test pinning the websockets header-kwarg contract.

The brain calls the **legacy** ``websockets.connect`` entrypoint, which
in websockets 13.x is exposed as ``websockets.legacy.client.Connect``.
That entrypoint accepts ``extra_headers``. The newer
``websockets.asyncio.client.connect`` renamed the same kwarg to
``additional_headers``.

If a future refactor swaps in ``additional_headers``, the legacy
``create_connection`` rejects the unknown kwarg with
``TypeError: create_connection() got an unexpected keyword argument
'additional_headers'`` and every voice provider silently fails to
connect (only surfacing as ``Voice session failed to connect`` warnings
in the brain log). This test catches the regression at unit-test time
instead of at real-hardware smoke time.

Pinned by the v2026.5.17 voice fix; see ``voice/realtime_proxy.py``
``OpenAIRealtimeProxy.connect`` and the parallel call sites in
``voice/gemini_realtime.py`` and ``voice/stt_providers/deepgram.py``.
