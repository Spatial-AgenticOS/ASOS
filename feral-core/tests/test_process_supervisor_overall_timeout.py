"""W18: overall (wall-clock) timeout kills the child within budget.

Contract: "enforces overall timeout". Spec: ``sleep 10`` with
overall_timeout=1 must die within
1.2s, the exit_code must show SIGTERM/SIGKILL (negative returncode
under asyncio convention), and the registry's kill_reason must be
``overall_timeout``.
