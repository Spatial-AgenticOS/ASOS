"""HTTP-surface tests for the MCP JSON-RPC and management routes.

These tests guard the wiring between ``feral-core/api/routes/mcp.py`` and
``mcp.server.FeralMCPServer``. They complement ``test_mcp_full.py`` which
covers the JSON-RPC protocol logic and ``FeralMCPServer.get_http_routes``.

Required tests (per docs/AGENT_PROMPTS.md §D.W3):

* ``test_mcp_routes_listed_in_openapi`` — every route registered under
  ``/mcp*`` appears in the OpenAPI schema served at ``/openapi.json``.
* ``test_mcp_endpoint_smoke_post`` — POSTing a minimal JSON-RPC 2.0
  envelope to ``/mcp`` returns 200 plus a JSON-RPC envelope with the
  caller's ``id`` echoed back.
