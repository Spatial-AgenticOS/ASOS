"""D1 — Phone-bearer allowlist ↔ real route coherence (audit-r12).

Pins the contract that every entry in every API-key middleware
allowlist (``_OPEN_PATHS``, ``_OPEN_GET_PATHS``, ``_PHONE_BEARER_GET``,
``_PHONE_BEARER_POST``) MUST resolve to at least one route actually
registered on ``api.server.app``.

Before this PR five entries had drifted:

- ``_PHONE_BEARER_GET`` advertised ``/api/ambient/digest``; the real
  ambient summary route is ``/api/ambient/briefing``
  (``api/routes/ambient.py:30``). iOS callers got 401 silently.
- ``_PHONE_BEARER_POST`` advertised ``/api/approvals/approve`` and
  ``/api/approvals/deny``; the real routes are
  ``/api/approvals/{request_id}/approve`` and
  ``/api/approvals/{request_id}/reject``
  (``api/routes/approvals.py:79, 93``). Operator approval gestures
  on the iOS Approvals tab 401'd silently.
- ``_PHONE_BEARER_POST`` advertised ``/api/sessions/primary/transcript``
  and ``/api/capabilities/has`` as POSTs; both routes are GET only
  (``api/routes/sessions.py:34``, ``api/routes/capabilities.py:129``).
  Dead allowlist entries — they didn't break anything operationally
  but proved the allowlist had no integrity check.

The fix is two parts:

1. Replace the per-method ``frozenset`` literals with a ``_PathAllowlist``
   that supports literal paths, prefix matches, and FastAPI-style
   parameterized patterns (``/api/approvals/{request_id}/approve``)
   compiled via Starlette's ``compile_path`` — so the matcher cannot
   diverge from FastAPI's own router by construction.
2. Run a startup invariant after ``app.include_router(...)`` is done
   that iterates ``app.routes`` and refuses to boot the brain if any
   allowlist entry doesn't resolve to a real route.

Tests in this file:

* ``test_startup_invariant_passes_against_real_app`` — the canonical
  coherence test. Runs ``_assert_allowlist_routes_exist(app)`` against
  the real ``api.server.app``; would have failed before the fix
  because of the five drifted entries above.
* Middleware behavior on the canonical paths under a phone bearer
  (approve / reject / briefing return non-401) and without auth (401).
* Removed paths (``/api/ambient/digest``, ``/api/approvals/approve``)
  must NOT be honored on a phone bearer after the fix.
