# Contributing to FERAL

FERAL is in **public beta** and we are actively looking for contributors. Whether you want to add a new LLM provider, ship a hardware daemon, harden security, or just file good bug reports — every lane below has a clear entry point.

> **Where the project runs today**
> macOS 13+ and modern Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 40+, Arch). Windows is not supported as a host yet — use WSL2 if you must. The CLI ships on PyPI as `feral-ai`.

## Development setup

Prerequisites:

- **Python 3.11+** (3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13 supported in CI).
- **Node.js 20+** (for `feral-client-v2`).
- **Git**, **make**, a working C toolchain (Xcode CLT on macOS, `build-essential` on Debian-likes).

Clone and bootstrap:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FERAL-AI/FERAL-AI.git
cd FERAL-AI
make dev                                 # creates .venv, installs feral-core in editable mode
```

Or install the published package and run from anywhere:

```bash
pip install "feral-ai[all]"
feral setup                              # interactive wizard: provider, model, network, identity
feral start                              # brain + dashboard + chat
```

The wizard renders an arrow-key picker (space to mark, enter to confirm). API key paste is masked. If your shell does not advertise itself as a TTY (some CI runners, raw `ssh` without `-t`) the wizard prints a typed-fallback hint.

For the web client live dev:

```bash
cd feral-client-v2
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Contributor lanes

Pick the lane that matches your interest. Each lane lists the canonical entry files.

### Runtime / orchestrator

Agent loop, LLM routing, multi-agent dispatch, TaskFlows, session lifecycle, security enforcement.

- `feral-core/agents/orchestrator.py`
- `feral-core/agents/multi_agent.py`
- `feral-core/api/server.py`
- `feral-core/security/`

### Memory / knowledge

4-tier memory store, wiki compilation, ingest pipelines, federated sync, knowledge graph.

- `feral-core/memory/store.py`
- `feral-core/memory/sync.py`

### GenUI / provider surfaces

SDUI engine, provider contract lifecycle, surface caching, client renderer, component library.

- `feral-core/genui/generator.py`
- `feral-client-v2/src/components/SduiRenderer.jsx`
- See [`docs/GENUI_PROVIDER_SPEC.md`](docs/GENUI_PROVIDER_SPEC.md) for the contract format.

### Hardware / daemons

Node WebSocket protocol, daemon SDKs, device profiles, edge bridges (BLE, MQTT, serial, ROS).

- `feral-core/hardware/protocol.py`
- `feral-core/hardware/mesh.py`
- `feral-nodes/`
- See [`docs/HARDWARE_ECOSYSTEM.md`](docs/HARDWARE_ECOSYSTEM.md) for the daemon contract.

### Voice / perception

Realtime voice proxy, wake word detection, vision pipeline, multimodal sensor fusion.

- `feral-core/voice/`
- `feral-core/perception/`

### Channels / providers

Telegram, Slack, Discord, Matrix, Signal, voice-call (Twilio), Feishu, Zalo + LLM provider adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Together, OpenRouter, Fireworks, Bedrock).

- `feral-core/channels/` — see `base.py` (`Channel`) + `telegram.py` for the working exemplar.
- `feral-core/providers/` — see `openai_provider.py` for the working exemplar.

### Frontend / shell

Web UI pages, dashboard, Tauri desktop wrapper, mobile bridges.

- `feral-client-v2/src/`
- `desktop/`

### Packaging / release

Wheel build, version coherence, sync_versions, PyPI publish workflow, Home Assistant add-on, NixOS flake.

- `feral-core/pyproject.toml`
- `scripts/sync_versions.py`
- `.github/workflows/`
- `flake.nix`

## Running tests

```bash
cd feral-core
python -m pytest tests/ -v --no-cov           # backend unit tests
ruff check .                                  # lint
```

```bash
cd feral-client-v2
npm test                                      # vitest
npm run build                                 # vite production bundle
```

CI runs the same commands plus an architecture-boundary check, version-coherence check, and webui_v2 bundled-asset coherence check.

## Code style

- Python: follow existing patterns. Type hints encouraged. `ruff` is the source of truth.
- JavaScript / React: existing JSX patterns, Tailwind for styling.
- Don't add comments that just narrate what the code does. Comments should capture intent, trade-offs, or constraints the code itself cannot convey.

## Pull requests

- One focused change per PR.
- Reference the contributor lane or area touched.
- Briefly describe what changed and why; call out any new dependency or migration.
- If you add a new extension surface (provider, daemon, skill), include a minimal working example.
- Be honest about limitations. We prefer "X works on macOS, Linux untested" over a silent assumption.
