# Voice Pipeline

FERAL supports three voice paths optimized for different latency, cost, and quality tradeoffs. All paths share a common `VoiceRouter` that selects the best pipeline per session.

## Voice Paths

### OpenAI Realtime

The lowest-latency option. Audio streams bidirectionally over a single WebSocket — no transcription step, no TTS step. The model hears your voice and speaks back directly.

```yaml
# ~/.feral/config.yaml
voice:
  mode: realtime
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o-realtime-preview
  vad: server  # server-side voice activity detection
```

Latency: **~150ms** end-to-end. Best for conversational use where natural interruption matters.

### Gemini Live

Google's bidirectional streaming voice API. Similar architecture to OpenAI Realtime but uses Gemini models.

```yaml
voice:
  mode: realtime
  provider: gemini
  model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

Supports tool calling mid-stream — the model can pause speech, execute a tool, and resume with the result.

### Whisper + Classic TTS

The fallback pipeline that works with any LLM provider. Audio is transcribed locally, sent as text to the LLM, and the response is synthesized back to speech.

```
mic → Whisper (local) → text → LLM → text → TTS → speaker
```

```yaml
voice:
  mode: whisper
  whisper_model: base.en    # tiny, base, small, medium, large
  tts_provider: openai      # openai, elevenlabs, piper (local)
  tts_voice: alloy
```

Latency: **400–800ms** depending on Whisper model size and LLM speed. Works offline with Ollama + Piper TTS.

## Wake Word Detection

FERAL uses [openwakeword](https://github.com/dscripka/openwakeword) for always-on, local wake word detection. No audio leaves the device until the wake word fires.

```yaml
voice:
  wake_word:
    enabled: true
    model: hey_feral       # built-in model
    threshold: 0.7         # detection confidence (0.0–1.0)
    cooldown_seconds: 2    # ignore repeated triggers
```

Custom wake words can be trained with ~50 positive samples:

```bash
feral voice train-wakeword \
  --name "hey jarvis" \
  --positive-dir ./samples/positive \
  --negative-dir ./samples/negative \
  --output ~/.feral/wakewords/hey_jarvis.onnx
```

The wake word detector runs in a dedicated thread with ~2% CPU overhead on modern hardware.

## VoiceRouter

The `VoiceRouter` decides which pipeline handles each session based on configuration, provider availability, and client capabilities.

```python
from feral_core.voice import VoiceRouter

router = VoiceRouter(config)

# Returns the best available pipeline for this session
pipeline = await router.resolve(
    preferred="realtime",
    client_supports_websocket=True,
    provider_available={"openai": True, "gemini": False},
)
# pipeline == OpenAIRealtimePipeline(...)
```

Fallback chain: `realtime → gemini_live → whisper`. If the preferred provider is down, the router degrades gracefully.

### Router Configuration

```yaml
voice:
  router:
    prefer: realtime
    fallback_chain:
      - openai_realtime
      - gemini_live
      - whisper
    timeout_ms: 5000        # max time to establish a voice session
    auto_switch: true        # switch mid-session if a provider fails
```

## Sub-200ms Latency Architecture

Achieving low latency requires minimizing hops between the user's mic and the model's audio output.

**Realtime path (OpenAI/Gemini):**

```
mic → WebSocket → provider (model + TTS in one step) → WebSocket → speaker
```

One network hop. The model generates audio tokens directly — no intermediate text.

**Optimizations applied:**

| Technique | Impact |
|:----------|:-------|
| Opus codec at 24kHz | 3× smaller frames vs raw PCM |
| Server-side VAD | No extra roundtrip for silence detection |
| Streaming playback | Speaker starts before full response arrives |
| Connection keep-alive | Eliminates WebSocket setup on subsequent turns |
| Edge routing | Provider SDKs route to nearest datacenter |

**Whisper path optimizations:**

| Technique | Impact |
|:----------|:-------|
| `base.en` model on GPU | ~100ms transcription for typical utterance |
| Streaming TTS | First audio chunk plays while rest generates |
| Sentence-level chunking | TTS starts per-sentence, not per-response |
| Local inference (Piper) | Eliminates TTS network roundtrip entirely |

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| `/v1/session` | WebSocket | Full duplex voice + text session |
| `/api/voice/config` | GET | Current voice pipeline configuration |
| `/api/voice/config` | PATCH | Update voice settings at runtime |
| `/api/voice/wakeword/status` | GET | Wake word detector status and metrics |

## Client Integration

The web UI connects via WebSocket and negotiates the voice path during the handshake:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:9090/v1/session");
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "session_init",
  voice: {
    enabled: true,
    preferred_mode: "realtime",
    sample_rate: 24000,
    codec: "opus",
  },
}));
```

The server responds with the resolved pipeline and codec parameters. Audio frames flow as binary WebSocket messages from that point.
