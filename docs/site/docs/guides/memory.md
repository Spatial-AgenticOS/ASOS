# Memory System

FERAL's memory is a four-tier architecture stored in a single SQLite database (`~/.feral/memory.db`). Each tier serves a different retention and retrieval pattern. On top of the tiers sit hybrid search, diversity reranking, session compaction, wiki compilation, and P2P sync.

## Four Memory Tiers

### Working Memory

In-RAM context for the current session. Holds the conversation history, tool results, and scratch state. Cleared when the session ends.

```python
session.working_memory.append({
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What's the weather in NYC?",
})
```

Working memory is capped at a configurable token budget. When it overflows, the oldest messages are compacted into an episode (see [Session Compaction](#session-compaction)).

### Episodic Memory

Auto-generated summaries of past conversations. Each episode captures the key facts, decisions, and outcomes from a session.

```sql
-- Schema
CREATE TABLE episodes (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT,
    summary TEXT,
    entities TEXT,        -- JSON array of extracted entities
    created_at REAL,
    embedding BLOB        -- 384-dim float32 vector
);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE episodes_fts USING fts5(summary, entities);
```

Episodes are created automatically when a session ends or when working memory overflows.

### Semantic Memory / Knowledge Graph

Persistent facts stored as subject-predicate-object triples. Extracted automatically from conversations or added explicitly via "remember X" commands.

```sql
CREATE TABLE knowledge_graph (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    subject TEXT,
    predicate TEXT,
    object TEXT,
    confidence REAL,
    source_episode TEXT,
    created_at REAL
);
```

```bash
# User says: "Remember that my doctor's name is Dr. Chen"
# Extracted triple:
# subject=user, predicate=doctor_name, object="Dr. Chen", confidence=0.95
```

### Execution Log

An append-only log of every tool invocation, including arguments, results, latency, and success/failure status.

```sql
CREATE TABLE execution_log (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT,
    tool_name TEXT,
    args TEXT,           -- JSON
    result TEXT,         -- JSON
    latency_ms INTEGER,
    success BOOLEAN,
    created_at REAL
);
```

Useful for debugging, skill auto-generation, and auditing what the agent actually did.

## Hybrid Search

Memory retrieval combines SQLite FTS5 (keyword) and vector similarity (semantic) to get the best of both worlds.

```python
from feral_core.memory import MemoryStore

store = MemoryStore()

results = await store.search(
    query="Dr. Chen appointment",
    top_k=10,
    strategy="hybrid",    # "fts", "vector", or "hybrid"
    alpha=0.6,            # weight: 0.0 = pure FTS, 1.0 = pure vector
)
```

**How hybrid scoring works:**

1. FTS5 returns top-N by BM25 score, normalized to `[0, 1]`.
2. Vector search returns top-N by cosine similarity, already in `[0, 1]`.
3. Scores are combined: `final = alpha * vector_score + (1 - alpha) * fts_score`.
4. Results are merged and deduplicated by ID.

Vector embeddings use `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions) by default, computed locally via `sentence-transformers`. For larger deployments, swap in OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` via config.

## MMR Diversity Reranking

After hybrid search, **Maximal Marginal Relevance** reranks results to reduce redundancy. Without MMR, the top-5 results might all describe the same event from different angles.

```python
results = await store.search(
    query="meeting notes",
    top_k=5,
    mmr=True,
    mmr_lambda=0.7,   # 1.0 = pure relevance, 0.0 = pure diversity
)
```

The algorithm iteratively selects the result that maximizes `lambda * relevance - (1 - lambda) * max_similarity_to_already_selected`.

## Session Compaction

When working memory exceeds its token budget, the compactor summarizes older messages into an episode and evicts them from the active context.

```json
// ~/.feral/settings.json — "memory" section
{
  "memory": {
    "working_memory_budget": 8000,
    "compaction_trigger": 0.85,
    "compaction_strategy": "summarize"
  }
}
```

The compaction flow:

1. Select messages beyond the budget.
2. Prompt the LLM to summarize them into a structured episode.
3. Insert the episode into `episodes` table with embedding.
4. Replace the compacted messages with a system note: `[Session compacted — N messages summarized]`.

## Wiki Compilation

The **Memory Wiki** compiles episodes, notes, and knowledge graph entries into durable, human-readable wiki pages organized by topic.

```bash
feral memory wiki compile
feral memory wiki list
feral memory wiki read "health"
```

Wiki pages are stored in `~/.feral/wiki/` as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter tracking provenance:

```yaml
---
topic: health
sources:
  - episode:abc123
  - kg:triple_456
last_compiled: 2025-06-15T10:30:00Z
---
# Health

- Doctor: Dr. Chen (added 2025-03-10)
- Blood type: O+ (added 2025-01-22)
- Allergies: penicillin (added 2025-04-05)
```

Compilation runs automatically on a schedule or on-demand. New facts merge into existing pages; conflicts are flagged for user review.

## P2P Sync

For multi-device setups (laptop + phone + home server), FERAL supports peer-to-peer memory synchronization over the `/sync` WebSocket endpoint.

```json
// ~/.feral/settings.json — "sync" section
{
  "sync": {
    "enabled": true,
    "peers": [
      "ws://homeserver.local:9090/sync",
      "ws://phone.local:9090/sync"
    ],
  conflict_resolution: last_write_wins  # or manual
```

Sync uses a CRDT-based merge strategy for knowledge graph triples and last-write-wins for episodes. Each node maintains a vector clock to detect and resolve conflicts.

```bash
# Check sync status
feral memory sync status

# Force sync now
feral memory sync push
feral memory sync pull
```
