# Contributing to FERAL

FERAL is building toward an agent-native operating system. That is a large mission and we need help from many kinds of engineers — backend, frontend, ML, hardware, Nix/packaging, and documentation.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feral-ai/feral.git
cd feral/feral-core
pip install -e ".[llm,dev]"
feral setup
feral serve    # brain running on localhost:9090
```

For the web UI (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd feral/feral-client
npm install
npm run dev     # dev server on localhost:5173
```

Or use Make targets from the repo root:

```bash
make dev        # install all deps
make serve      # brain
make client     # web UI dev server
make test       # run pytest
make help       # list all targets
```

## Code Style

### Python

- **Type hints** on all function signatures.
- **Ruff** for linting, **Black**-compatible formatting.
- Keep functions focused and short. Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid broad `except:` blocks — catch specific exceptions.

### TypeScript / React

- **Strict mode** enabled.
- **Prettier** for formatting.
- Functional components with hooks.

### General

- No commented-out code in PRs.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*.
- New features should include tests.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit + integration tests
pytest

# With coverage report
pytest --cov --cov-report=term

# Target: 70% coverage minimum
```

Test files live in `feral-core/tests/`. Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests — the `asyncio_mode = "auto"` config handles the event loop.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

2. **Write tests** for new functionality.

3. **Run the test suite** and ensure it passes:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. **Open a PR** against `main` with a clear title and description:
   - What changed and why.
   - How to test the change.
   - Screenshots for UI changes.

5. **One approval** from a maintainer is required to merge.
